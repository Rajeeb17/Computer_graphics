Project BRIDGE – Summary & Explanation

1. Overview

This OpenGL–GLUT program creates a **2D animated bridge environment** containing:

* Two moving **trains**
* Two moving **cars**
* **Clouds**, **boats**, and a **hot air balloon**
* **River, road, railway line, bridge, street lights**
* **Day/Night mode**
* **Keyboard & mouse interaction**
* **Smooth animation using timer**

The scene is drawn using **immediate mode OpenGL (glBegin/glEnd)** with **orthographic projection**.

---

2. Graphics Setup (`initGL`)

```cpp
gluOrtho2D(-10.0, 10.0, -5.0, 5.0);
```

* Defines a **2D world coordinate system**
* X-axis: `-10 to +10`
* Y-axis: `-5 to +5`
* Background color initially set to **sky blue**

---

3. Environment Objects

 🌞 Sun & 🌙 Moon

* Drawn using **polygons**
* Display depends on `isDay` flag
* Position fixed in sky

---

☁ Clouds

* Created using circular polygons
* Move horizontally at different speeds
* Color changes:

  * **White (day)**
  * **Dark gray (night)**

---

🌉 Bridge & Infrastructure

Includes:

* **Bridge pillar**
* **Railway wall**
* **Road walls**
* **Rail ground**
* **Road with center white line**

All drawn using **GL_QUADS**

---

🌊 River

* Rectangle base
* Animated **sine-wave effect** for water movement using:

```cpp
sin(glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME))
```

---

 💡 Street Lights

* Vertical pole + circular yellow light
* Positioned using repeated function calls

---

4. Vehicles**

🚆 Trains (Two directions)

* **Train 1** moves left
* **Train 2** moves right
* Each train has:

  * Locomotive
  * Chimney
  * Windows
  * Wheels (circular)
  * Passenger cars
* Speed controlled via keyboard

---
 🚗 Cars

* Two cars moving in opposite directions
* Features:

  * Body
  * Roof
  * Windows
  * Wheels
* Speed adjustable via keyboard

---

⛵ Boats

* Two boats moving across river
* Reset position after leaving screen

---

🎈 Hot Air Balloon

* Moves automatically
* Can be **dragged using mouse**
* Bounded within screen limits

---

5. Animation System (`updateScene`)

Uses **GLUT timer**:

```cpp
glutTimerFunc(50, updateScene, 0);
```

Handles:

* Train movement
* Car movement
* Cloud drift
* Boat movement
* Balloon auto-movement (if not dragged)
* Pause/Resume support

---

 6. Interaction

 ⌨ Keyboard Controls

| Key     | Action                  |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| `Y / N` | Day / Night mode        |
| `Q / A` | Train-1 speed up / down |
| `W / S` | Train-2 speed up / down |
| `E / D` | Car-1 speed up / down   |
| `R / F` | Car-2 speed up / down   |
| `SPACE` | Pause / Resume          |
| `X`     | Reset all speeds        |

---

 🖱 Mouse Controls

* **Click & drag** hot air balloon
* Cursor changes when hovering balloon
* Screen-to-world coordinate conversion used

---

7. Rendering (`drawScene`)

* Clears screen
* Sets background color based on time
* Draws objects in correct **layer order**
* Ensures smooth animation

---

8. Key Programming Concepts Used

* OpenGL **immediate mode**
* **2D transformations**
* **Timer-based animation**
* **Keyboard & mouse handling**
* **Trigonometric animation (sin wave)**
* **Bounding & reset logic**
* Modular function design
